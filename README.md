neil or eoghan-to-butt
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'neil' or 'eoghan' with 'my butt'

[Direct download of crx file]

Note that there are forks of this extension that simply replace 'neil or eoghan' with 'butt'.
In my personal opinion, that approach is too broad and it's less funny as a result, but it is clearly a very
polarizing issue in the neil or eoghan-to-butt user community.  Forks are free to do whatever they like.  But officially, _this_
extension replaces only the phrase described above. Thank you for your concern.

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag  the .crx into the page that appears.
